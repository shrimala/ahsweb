I understood this to mean that I aspire to be born where there is no karma and klesha and suffering - in other words a Pure Land.┬á It might also mean that I aspire to be born where the influences are all positive with no negative influences at all. but as Kamalashila pointed out, if there is no word of karma and suffering then we would have no motivation to practise Dharma or work for the benefit of beings. That is why I think of it as meaning may I never be influenced in a negative way by suffering and karma - not even by hearing them talked about. But I agree it is a funny line really.

the questioning aspect of our experience alive? / how can we distinguish whether it would be more beneficial for us to take a break during periods of agitation in meditation or to stay with the disturbance? / when we meet others is it the same or different from meeting our own experience? / in relation to self preservation and openness it feels like there is something to protect, how do I know when to go forward and when to stay back and what is worth protecting?/ what is the Buddhist view on the journey from childhood to adulthood?/ how should I relate to memories of strong experiences of openness encountered during childhood? / how can there be action from a place of no self-reference? / what is stable in our experience, how should we relate to it, and how does it gets distorted?', 'Avidya would just dissolve if the thinking didn''t come along and whip it up into something / it wouldn''t actually be a problem if we could immediately recognize the truth again / so if Avidya isn''t continuous how come I''m not awakened? / it is like turning on a light in a dark room; when the light comes on where does the dark go? / it is a good image to ponder on and check with your own direct experience / the reason why we are not awakened is because we make the mistake of identifying with the dark more than the light and then solidifying it as reality / the Buddha said that these are the two big things that a Bodhisattva realizes the purity from the very beginning and how that can be obscured / by realizing the nature of awakening you simultaneously understand the nature of non-awakening / in the Mahamudhra we say even the thoughts that arise are the Dharmakaya / this is a very subtle point to reflect on / trying to bring the questioning aspect of meditation alive / thinking that you already know your experience kills the situation / that dead feeling is a sign that your not getting it and can be used as a trigger of awareness/ it is good to be as naive as possible when questioning / really try and explore your direct experience / keep with it and further questions will start to bubble up naturally / this is an excellent way to gain insight / it doesn''t have to be one ultimate answer it could be a whole falling away of a whole lot of concepts / when you are doing this properly you start to notice that you don''t know where you are and what you are asking anymore / you begin to notice your subtle concepts of me in here and my experience out there and a weird boundary between the two / you realize that you are subtlety thinking like this all the time / try and do it without a sense of trying to come up with an answer / with time it is fun just being with experience being fascinated with what ever is arising and when the session comes to an end you don''t even notice the difference between meditation and non-meditation / you find a way of just letting be and with this comes a sense of relief or enjoyment / ideally it should be possible to sit through everything / rely on your own power of discernment to distinguish when some states of mind are leading to more and more instability/ it is not an endurance test and you need to find that balance between being disciplined but not being too hard on yourself / even though we only ever experience our own experience somehow intuitively we can tell the difference between self and other / between something that''s merely appearing in our awareness and a sense of somebody or something else outside of our experience that''s not me / then there''s meaningful communication happening in your experience between self and other / you could make the mistake of thinking that what ever appears is just your own mind / this could manifest as delusion or madness/ there''s an awake alive quality which is quite the opposite of the dead flat feeling of nothing or nobody communicating with you in your experience / RS describes it as the 3 spheres / the sphere of self / sphere of other / and the sphere in between the two which is an interface in which the things that are appearing in your awareness appear / they are sort of other but on the interface/ you realize there''s something significant/ RS calls it an opening movement/ at first you are stuck and can''t find any meaning to your experience but then there''s is this AHH movement and its like OH I SEE/ the deepest suffering is not recognizing the true meaning and significance of our experience it permeates everything / realizing emptiness is liberation because it has meaning / we protect our whole Mandala of OCS when we stay open and in touch with our experience / pulling away would mean closing off and hardening this would indicate a lack of confidence and a futile attempt at trying to protect what is not OCS you need to develop confidence in your true nature of OCS which is essentially indestructible/ fundamentally we have the same attitude of someone who is quite closed but someone who is in a very spacious place/ in relation to choice and free will the connections are there / there''s the outer sphere and then there''s the inner sphere of what we bring to it / so the choices are all in the way we respond to meeting with all these connections so this gives us a lot of freedom/ the connectedness of things and of reality is very strange and mysterious / as you open during meditation it can bring up strong experiences of openness experienced during childhood/ time is just an idea / use what ever memories help /the phrase ''turn towards experience'' can help a lot when we find intense resistance to trying to be open/ try to relax into the restlessness itself and really turn towards it / welcome it like a guest /with really persistent thoughts and feelings its sometimes more beneficial to allow them to manifest in order to really listen to their message rather than just letting it go / when ever considering the possibility of leaving all worldly commitments behind you must be able to accurately gauge your own ability of being able to do it cleanly and decisively / shaving your head wearing the robe and becoming a monk could even be a trap/ there''s never a time when you''ve got no awareness/ we would of lost our connection with the awareness previously / during sleep you just have this belief that there has been a gap in your awareness/ the thought of time arises in awareness / but awareness doesn''t fit into time / time only exists in awareness/ you need to open out into the situation let your sensitivity go out and fully meet the situation / you have

there are four levels of sacred history and sacred geography: the outer, inner, secret, and sometimes slightly mysteriously called ''fourth'', thatata (which means suchness or thusness)'' or very secret/ biographies about the fourth level tend to be very short/ biographies about the outer levels are not just about ordinary events/ a) sacred history: In the historical outer level ordinary events are given Dharma significance/ this is not a question of forced feeding a goose of history to give it special significance/ really the special significance is there in itself/ if we do not see it, it is due to confusion about mind/ the inner level of vimoksha is associated with meditation experiences, sometimes the battles they had with demons or negative forces, and how they were attracted to what it was good or wholesome/ the inner life is obviously not divorced from the outer life, but there is more concentration on what one may view as a more seemingly magical way of looking at things/ the secret level is connected to getting down to the very basis of the profound vision of jnana or dharma, particularly with the transformation of emotions (hatred, desire, delusion, etc) and how these transformations manifested/ the fourth one might be couched in mysterious language as it is beyond words and concepts/ b) sacred geography:in the outer level, one may see the country associated with the deeds of the lama as places one might be able to visit/ sacred history also includes the interaction of the lama with the rulers of the country and how its is interwoven with its general history/ the ''inner geography'' could show that there is something very special about a certain place/ entering such a place could make us feel inspired/ it is as if the place carries some living essence/ visiting a place connected with the inner level could open the possibility of seeing the world as pure-land/ any conditioned place could offer us that possibility, but in such a sacred place there is a certain ''thinness of confusion''/ the terton Jomo Memo (lit. the reverent fairy-lady) first met Vajra Yogini in such a place/ the fourth level might be that by going into a place by means of the adhistana of Buddha mediated by some teacher, one may be able to experience some kind of realization/ How do Buddha''s teachings of awakening appear before us?/ because one begins to awaken the world begins to be transformed into sacred history and geography/ having the confidence for walking into that kind of experience/ unless one practices something like formless meditation, one can only have blind faith/ the mind becomes clarified through formless meditation/ knowing through our senses and our relaxed mind (as opposed to the busy mind)/ the belief that the world is totally graspable is a kind of hypnotism/ what I know is what I create in my mind/ is there anything more than that?/ there may be something that corresponds to an external world, but is not that notion of materiality that we carry throughout our lives/ we do not have direct experience of anything except our sense perceptions and what our mind creates/ but there may be something subtle that one can experience beyond that/ it is often said that the teaching of the Buddha is the teaching of awareness/ Trungpa Rinpoche thought that the best way for entering into the path was through the quality of openness, which eventually leads to awareness/ there is a different approach to this, Trungpa used to emphasize the ''awake'' quality/ we need the ''awake'' quality to step beyond confusion and non-confusion/ awakening from the idea of being bound or free, from grasping the things of this world, from acceptance and rejection, from regarding the perceptions themselves as if they were graspable things/ the essence of the formless meditation is the awake quality (bodhi, chang chup)/ before us, there is all the time the vast space of ''nowness'', the vast space of ''suchness'', the vast space of the ''fourth moment'', or the vast space of ''''what it is''/ this space is here and now, but not in the present moment/ being stripped of all concepts would not allow you to do anything, this is to do with a particular experience of meditation/ what matters is the vipashyana quality, the ''awakenness into the space of what is''/ everything that one has ever wanted is in the immediacy of this space, in the primordial knowing/ primordial means ''not in the three-times''/ awakening into the wild space of oneness, comes from the simplicity of the space of meditation/ one enters into that living space instantly like the garuda chick who does not have to learn to fly/ falling in love with our own creation like Narcissus/ creativity could make samsara or nirvana/ having the power to create is not itself enough/ the play aspect of experience/ ones in not passive recipient of sense perceptions/ the play aspect of creativity can be confused or unconfused/ the unconfused aspect could mysteriously mirror things/ the ornamentation or beautification of the space itself is what we regard as external objects/ the key is not to grasp, not to possess, not to reject/ merely to know these things, it is not enough, one needs the awake quality/ the quality of knowing has to be connected to the quality of being awake/ the metaphor of climbing a mountain with only one peak blindfolded/ vydia is the quality of being free from ignorance, and can discriminate from what it is awake and what it is not/ the quality of immediacy, which transcends time, is what allows us to talk about sacred history and geography/ the awakened heart expresses itself in terms of the qualities of a) love, compassion, joy, balance of mind, b) the spontaneous activities of the paramitas, c) never giving up, d) unremitting awareness and complete relaxation (Bodhicitta), and e) complete awakenness itself/ if you have these your life and those of those around you are sacred history and

N.B. a PDF of Introduction to the PSME Package can be downloaded and/or printed by clicking on the attachment at the bottom of this page.', 'Introduction to the Progressive Stages of Meditation on Emptiness On-line Resource PackageBy Lama Shenpen HookhamThe materials in this package have been put together by my student, Tara Dew, from recordings, transcripts of teachings and transmissions that I have given over the years. She also drew on materials put together by Katie Morrow when she ran an on-line course on Progressive Stages of Meditation on Emptiness. Ideally students would attend retreats on the Progressive Stages of Meditation on Emptiness so that they could receive live transmission and have personal interviews with a teacher as they work on the materials. There are many pitfalls to the study and practice of teachings on Emptiness. They are directed at our most profoundly held assumptions about the nature of reality. The more deeply held an assumption the more subtle and powerful it is and when those assumptions give way the effect on us is profound and can be quite overwhelming. That is why there are many warnings about not teaching Emptiness to students too soon, before they are prepared for the shock and have the faith and commitment to the path that will enable them to take the initial understanding further.In the West we tend not to realise that there is a three-fold process involved in the development of insight. There is the initial moment of insight beginning to dawn as we let go of any kind of false assumption. There is a moment of doubt about the assumption that allows the truth to peep through and give us a kind of jolt. From this we develop an initial understanding. We tend to immediately try to understand it and create a kind of representation of it for ourselves for reference. We might use an image or a word, maybe we construct a model or simply try to remember the feeling of it. This is all on the level of a conceptual understanding. The conceptual understanding helps us to return to the initial insight in order to take it deeper. It helps us to drop assumptions that are clearly false in the light of that insight. However, very quickly we start to attach ourselves to the conceptual version of the insight and try to own it somehow. That is how the ego-mandala structure tries to incorporate the understanding into itself. In the case of an insight into Emptiness this is actually turning the insight into a kind of ally for the ego in order to disempower it. The ego-mandala very soon is treating the insight as insignificant or if it is significant it is significant because it has somehow enhanced the ego mandala. For example we might feel we are really quite clever people to have had such a marvellous insight. This kills the insight which is what the ego mandala wants. It doesnΓÇÖt want the insight to fundamentally undermine its whole mechanism.That is why we have to keep meditating on Emptiness over and over again until we learn to over-ride the ego-mandalas efforts to sabotage the whole process of liberating insight into Emptiness.Eventually, the truth of Emptiness that we are beginning to understand breaks through strongly enough for a deeply transformative direct experience of it to break through. This might arise little by little as the months and years go by. However it might break through all at once straightaway so that we feel quite shocked and even frightened. It is like our whole world starting to fall apart. This is a ΓÇýnyamΓÇÖ. ΓÇýNyamΓÇÖs are useful reference points for us. It is good to remember them but not to try to recreate them. Trying to recreate a nyam simply leads to frustration and blocks any further deepening of the practice. If what we experienced in the nyam was Reality then it is always there and accessible. The fact that we donΓÇÖt usually experience it clearly means that when it does break through we find it shocking or exciting. Actually it is very ordinary because it is real and always there. So we have to practice in order to drop all our false assumptions that make it feel special. This takes far longer than simply the initial flash of understanding. It takes years and years of persistent practice. Stability is hard won. It is important to remember the lives of the Buddhist practitioners who attained full Awakening. It didnΓÇÖt happen over-night and without tremendous dedication and determination. Nyams gradually give way to full realisation. Full realisation is preceded by dawning realisation and the Progressive Stages of Meditation on Emptiness point to a series of dawning realisations that take the whole process deeper and deeper. It is not the case that the first level has to stop at a certain level of realisation. As we approach the Shravaka level of understanding of Emptiness we might find that it takes us immediately to a level of understanding that goes beyond the level described in the first chapter of Progressive Stages of Meditation on Emptiness. That is why it is important to be in touch with a teacher as one goes through the stages.You might wonder therefore what is the point of recommending to you to read the book Progressive Stages of Meditation on Emptiness by Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche. I find that for most people it is helpful to work through this book at your own pace a number of times and work on the meditations at the end of each chapter. This will help you arrive at an initial understanding and a general sense of direction in which the progressive stages are moving. You may or may not have any world shattering direct experiences (nyams) as you do this. Nonetheless, something will be happening that will be preparing the ground for the process of deepening insight to arise. The chances of it arising is enhanced by the way you have set up your practice mandala. You need to treat the whole exercise as a matter of life and death. If you want to escape the endless cycle of samsara and face death with confidence, it is important to make pranidhanas to that end and approach the meditation on Emptiness like a drowning person desperately trying to swim. Emptiness is like gulps of air that our life depends on.Because it is so important to have prepared oneself before being introduced to Emptiness, I suggest that my students first finish the DHB and perhaps also the THB before moving on to Progressive Stages on Emptiness. However, many people are introduced to Progressive Stages of Meditation on Emptiness without this kind of preparation and seem to gain some benefit from it so that seems to be a possible approach. It might be a good preparation for DHB and THB for some students. Another possibility for a student with sufficient time on their hands is to practice the Progressive Stages on Emptiness at the same time at DHB but this might just end up being confusing. In general my advice is to finish DHB at least before moving on to looking at these materials. If possible I suggest students try to join in the next on-line course and/or on retreat on Progressive Stages. However, we can only run courses and retreats from time to time when there is someone to organise and teach them and enough students all willing to commit themselves at the same time in order to work through the materials together. We are putting the materials of this package together for students who are working on deepening the six areas in Living the Awakened Heart and need to work more on the second area on Insight into Emptiness. They may have done an on-line course or retreat on the Progressive Stages already and want to take their understanding deeper so these materials could help with that. The Progressive Stages will need to be visited and revisited again and again until their full significance dawns.Other recommended materials can be found in the Living the Awakened Heart Booklet.Finally a word about transmissions. Some of the transcripts and recordings are taken from transmissions. The point about a transmission as opposed to simply a teaching is that it requires a special kind of openness on the part of the student and the teacher. Something actually happens when the intention to open on the side of the teacher meets with the same intention on the side of the student. A living bond is forged and has tremendous power to draw the student in to the Mandala of Awakening. It is important to try to participate in transmission events so that you start to be drawn in in this way. The way this works is like igniting a fire. Sometimes a spark might fly off and set dry tinder alight without any formal process but usually the fuel has to be prepared carefully, it has to be dried out and arranged carefully and set alight with some skill. It is not a perfect example but I hope it will give you at least some sense of the importance of living transmission.When I give transmission of the Progressive Stages I am meditating on them and linking into the lineage of my teachers as best I can so that their adhistana will pass through me to my students. I talk as insight arises in me in what one might call a guided meditation. The words of these transmissions have been recorded and form a useful support for students after the transmissions and for students coming along later who can use them to prepare themselves for transmission. Who knows how dry the tinder is and how small a spark is needed to start the fire of insight burning? For a long time I have been hesitant to make the transmission transcripts and recordings available for those not present at the transmission. I am beginning to develop the view that perhaps the benefits of allowing students to use them as preparation for transmission outweigh the possible disadvantages. The possible disadvantages are that students might not realise the importance of receiving transmission live and kind of get away with receiving the teachings on Emptiness without really opening to a living teacher in a genuine way. This allows the student to somehow avoid opening out fully and to fool themselves into thinking they understand more than they do. There are many, many dangers to trying to practice Dharma without relating to the teacher properly. However, if students have no taste of what the teachings and transmissions are about, then they may not ever find the motivation to seek a teacher to receive transmissions. Teachers bringing the Dharma to the West these days are faced with many dilemmas of this kind and we are all looking for solutions that will help the people of our times. It is a time for experimentation and pioneering new approaches for people with a completely different cultural background to those in countries that have been Buddhist for centuries if not millennia.', 'Lama Shenpen Hookham', '', 'PSME REC 01 Overview of all 5 views in practice (recording) AND Introduction to the Package (TEXT 1);2122;/Recordings and transcripts (1)/PSME/PSME ON LINE PACKAGE;overview of all 5 views in practice.mp3;;mp3/2014_01_01_overview_of_all_5_views_in_practice.mp3;;2014 01 01 overview of all 5 views in practice;/resources/recordings/mp3/2014_01_01_overview_of_all_5_views_in_practice.mp3;;Good;', '', 'Needs remastering', 'recordings/audio/2014/2014-01-01 0000 PSME REC 01 Overview of all 5 views in practice (recording) AND Introduction to the Package (TEXT 1).mp3', 259, '2122'),

If, bhikkhus, there were no not-born, not-brought-to-being, not-made, not-conditioned, no escape would be discerned from what is born, brought-to-being, made, conditioned. But since there is a not-born, a not-brought-to-being, a not-made, a not-conditioned, therefore an escape is discerned from what is born, brought-to-being, made, conditioned.Udana 8.3 Translated by J. IrelandCan there be conditioned phenomena in the sense of things somehow arising from conditions coming together. For example if you think of a rainbow it seems to be present in all its clarity, precision and beauty. It even has an effect in the sense that it could be reflected in a lake or a rain drop. If the sun was shining from a different angle or there was more or less water in the air the rainbow would not appear.All the conditions have to be right and then it appears but it is not there - you cannot find it anywhere - it is nothing other than the play of the light and the impact on our awareness through our eyes. The colours are experience only present in awareness - the particular conjunction of conditions that trigger an awareness of rainbow colours in our experience is simply that.But what are the conditions? I wonder if they are simply a story of some kind.....a story about relationships and meaning. Without the story and meaning the conditions are simply a seamless web - nothing distinguished from anything else and all equally without meaning or significance. What is light if it is not seen - if it were never seen - ever? What is information on a computer if it is never seen - ever? Is it still information? Is it still light?The actual word for conditioned is actually ''made'' or ''made up'', ''constructed'' or ''produced''. I wonder if one couldn&''t even translate it as ''determined''. Once awareness has focused on something and made it into something different from everything else - that first distinction has been made. It is like when we determine or choose a point and place a pencil mark on the clean piece of paper. Now there is the point and the rest of the paper - we have determined a particular mandala with centre and periphery. It is quite a good exercise to simply play with that first determination or choice, the precision of that single point, which creates one and many, self and other, centre and periphery, direction, distance and so on. The actual point is dimensionless; it is of a completely different order to all that it creates because it cannot be determined. It has no limits. It is known intuitively and yet it defines all that is defined in relation to it. It both destroys the unity of the non-determined as well as creating the diversity. Without it there is no diversity. All that is determined is impermanent and ultimately not the real, not the non-determined, the non-conditioned. Yet by focusing on the impermanence of the determined, one can find one&''s way back to the unity and wholeness of the non-determined. Our longing for connection, heart connection is fulfilled. I want you all to reflect deeply on what conditioned means so that we do not fall into the danger of rejecting our experience in the effort to let go of wrong views. It is easy to think that &ldquo;conditioned things" means everything I experience, life itself, everything that I am attached to and enjoy. So I should give all that up. The path is much more subtle than that. It is true that, when we do not see reality as it is, we get attached to things that will fail us and this causes endless instances of suffering. But there is a suffering that goes much deeper than that. There is the suffering of being attached to a view of reality that rejects our experience - or to use other terms, rejects the life within us - or to use AHS terms - that rejects the Openness, Clarity and Sensitivity of our being. Openness is exactly that - it is not determined and so not limited in any way. That is why it is not impermanent. It is the only thing that can be called our true self or being. Clarity is not determined; it is open, ungraspable and so again our true being. Sensitivity is not determined; it is open, ungraspable and alive with the qualities of life, our true being. What is not determined is not limited in any way. It belongs to a different order of reality. If it is determined it is not the non-determined. It has to be limited and dependently arising.If ultimate reality is non-determined, the non-conditioned, is it necessarily a bad thing to be dependently arising, determined or conditioned? Do we have to be deluded for dependently arising phenomena or conditioned phenomena to appear?I am giving you these questions for two main purposes. Firstly, to counter any tendency within the Sangha to call life itself samsara. And secondly, this means you all have to be clear that dependent arising is a very deep teaching and not just a view you can grasp hold of. For example, it is easy to grasp the idea that all conditioned things are impermanent as if it&''s kind of self-evident and not saying very much. Everyone knows that - so what? If we took it to mean everything is changing all the time so if you go with that you won&''t suffer, there is no more any sense of meaning, purpose or direction in life. Hedonism would be just as valid as trying to reach Awakening - in fact much more valid, to my way of thinking.However, we all intuit a connection with life and reality that is meaningful and significant and satisfying - intensely so and we long for it. &ldquo;All conditioned things are impermanent and not self" is pointing to that - what is conditioned is suffering from not being that. I wonder if we could think in terms of: once the determination has taken place, as soon as we forget that this is emanating from the non-determinate, we experience the pain of longing for that which we have forgotten?', 'Lama Shenpen Hookham', '', 'PSME REC 03 getting not-self right AND ''what does conditioned mean?''
