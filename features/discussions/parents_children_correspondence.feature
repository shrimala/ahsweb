Feature: Discussions Corresponding Entity References
  In order to set both the parents and children of a discussion from the discussion
  As any user editing a discussion
  I need my changes to be synced to the parents and children

  #These tests assume normal entity reference widget behaviors.
  #They still work even though these fields use the er_enhanced widget,
  #because while that widget uses css/js to hide the form elements,
  #they are still actually there on the non-js browser used here
  #since these steps are not tagged @javascript.
