Feature: Events Corresponding Entity References
  In order to set sessions from an event and vice versa
  As any user editing an event or a session
  I need my changes to be synced from the event to the sessions, or from the session to the event

  Background:
    Given I am logged in as an administrator

  Scenario: Creating an event with a session sets the event reference on the session
    Given a session with the title "Session1"
    And "event" content:
      | title      | field_sessions   |
      | Event1     | Session1         |
    When I am at "/admin/content"
    And I click "Event1"
    And I click "Manage recordings"
    Then I should see "Sessions in an IEF complex widget":
      | contains  |
      | Session1  |
    When I click "Session1"
    Then I should see "Event1" displayed from the "field_event" field

  Scenario: Creating an event with 2 sessions sets the event reference on both sessions
    Given a session with the title "Session1"
    And a session with the title "Session2"
    And "event" content:
      | title      | field_sessions     |
      | Event1     | Session1, Session2 |
    When I am at "/admin/content"
    And I click "Event1"
    And I click "Manage recordings"
    Then I should see "Sessions in an IEF complex widget":
      | contains  |
      | Session1  |
      | Session2  |
    When I click "Session1"
    Then I should see "Event1" displayed from the "field_event" field
    When I am at "/admin/content"
    And I click "Event1"
    And I click "Manage recordings"
    And I click "Session2"
    Then I should see "Event1" displayed from the "field_event" field
