Feature: Events listings
  In order to offer events and give context for teaching sessions
    we need a record of events 

  # Events are accessible to anonymous users.

  Scenario: Events content type exists
    When I visit "node/add/event"
    Then the response status code should be 200 

  Scenario: Events have URL events/year/month/day/titleword1-titleword2-etc
    Given event content:
      | title         | field_datetime      |
      | event1        | 2005-12-30 00:00:00 |
      | event2        | 2005-10-01 11:05:23 |
      | Event 3       | 2005-10-01 13:00:00 |
      | Event, and 4  | 2005-10-01 13:00:00 |
    When I visit "events/2005/12/30/event1"
    When I visit "events/2005/10/01/event2"
    When I visit "events/2005/10/01/event-3"
    When I visit "events/2005/10/01/event-and-4"
    Then the response status code should be 200

  Scenario: Events url use venue time zone
    # Event times are interpreted in site default time (Europe/London)
    # by Behat, but then reinterpreted using venue time zone at presave.
    # No venue = use default venue timezone Europe/London = BST on 30 June.
    # So paths use the venue time zone date, not the UTC date.
    Given venue content:
      | title         | field_timezone  |
      | Venue1        | America/Phoenix |
      | Venue2        | Asia/Kolkata    |
    Given event content:
      | title         | field_datetime      | field_venue |
      | event1        | 2005-12-30 03:00:00 | Venue1      |
      | event2        | 2005-12-30 23:00:00 | Venue2      |
      | event3        | 2005-06-30 23:30:00 |             |
