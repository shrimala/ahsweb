# Access control problems, test users need to be given access to sessions
Feature: Managing event sessions
  In order to create and edit sessions for events around the world
  As any user anywhere in the world who can create or edit sessions
  I need to be able to set session times assuming the venue's time zone.

  Background:
    # Pacific/Midway (UTC -11), Africa/Nairobi (UTC + 3), Asia/Kolkata (UTC + 05:30)
    # and America/Phoenix (UTC -7) never have DST.
    Given users:

      | John London   | Europe/London     | 1      |               |
      | Harry Phoenix | America/Phoenix   | 1      |               |
    Given venue content:
      | title                     | field_timezone  |
      | A venue in Phoenix        | America/Phoenix |
      | A venue in Nairobi        | Africa/Nairobi  |
      | A venue without time zone |                 |
    Given event content:
      | title           | field_datetime      | field_venue               |
      | Event1          | 2035-12-29 12:00:00 | A venue in Phoenix        |
      | Event2          | 2035-12-29 12:00:00 |                           |
      | Event3          | 2035-12-29 12:00:00 | A venue without time zone |
