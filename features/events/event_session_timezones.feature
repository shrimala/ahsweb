# Access control problems, test users need to be given access to sessions
Feature: Event sessions
  In order to participate in an event live
  As any user with access to event sessions
  I need to see coming event sessions according to both venue and my time zones.

  Background:
    # Pacific/Midway (UTC -11), Africa/Nairobi (UTC + 3), Asia/Kolkata (UTC + 05:30)
    # and America/Phoenix (UTC -7) never have DST.
    # So if a session is at 12pm for an event in Phoenix, that will be 00:30  the next
    # day for a user in Kolkata.
    Given users:
      | name          | timezone          | status | roles         |
